# Livewire Resource Time Grid

This package allows you to build resource/time grid to show events in a "calendar" way. You can define resources as 
anything that owns an event, eg. a particular day, a user, a client, etc. Events loaded with the component will be then
rendered in columns according to the resource it belongs to and the starting date of the event.
